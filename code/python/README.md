The Python script chlamy_modeler.py script uses matplotlib, a popular data visualization library, to create and display a graphical representation of cellular dimensions as an ellipse, based on provided mean dimensions and standard deviations. The code specifically handles cell size data, taking mean values and standard deviations for length and width to create ellipses that represent average cell size and cell size variability. This script generates and displays a graphical representation (as an ellipse) of a cell's dimensions (length and width), taking into account the mean and standard deviation of these dimensions. It also computes and displays the cell's eccentricity. The output is both a visual plot and a saved SVG file.
