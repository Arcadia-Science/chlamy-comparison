The Cellprofiler pipeline takes probability maps that were the outputs of an Ilastik pixel classfication. The output is the segmented cells as objects in images. Foreground was defined as pixels with >= 50% probability of a chlamydomonas cell. A size cutoff was implemented so only objects between 5 and 40 pixels in diameter were considered objects.
