# Phenotypic Analysis of Interfertile Algal Species

This repository contains code for image processing and analysis to compare phenotypes of interfertile *Chlamydomonas* species. These analyses are included in the publication [Phenotypic differences between interfertile Chlamydomonas species](https://doi.org/10.57844/arcadia-35f0-3e16).

# Computational Protocols

For each step run the commands indicated in code blocks from the "chlamy-comparison" directory.

## Protocol for segmenting cells and taking measurements of 2D morphology

This protocol is a step by step computational guide to segment algal cells from video data. The input is video data of algal cells collected by brightfield or differential interference contrast microscopy. The output includes segmented cells as "objects" as well as measurements of the 2D morphology of the cells. For related experimental results [follow this link](https://research.arcadiascience.com/pub/result-chlamydomonas-phenotypes#nj8khdxj90e).

1. Download data from Zenodo. This will be a directory called "experiments" with subdirectories and image data. Use [zenodo_get](https://github.com/dvolgyes/zenodo_get).

        zenodo_get 10.5281/zenodo.8326749

2. Crop "pools" of swimming cells from raw videos using the [Fiji](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/) Macro batch_interactive_crop_savetif.v.0.0. Samples of raw videos are contained in the the "experiments/{experiment}/raw_sample" directories. Choose "experiments" as the input directory. [Link to Fiji macro](./code/FIJI/batch_interactive_crop_savetif.ijm)

3. Parse focal sequences of frames from "pools". [Link Python script](./code/python/morphology_2d/focus_filter_laplacian.py)

        python3 code/python/morphology_2d/focus_filter_laplacian.py
   
5. Sample the focal sequences randomly to generate a training set for pixel classification. [Link to Python script](./code/python/morphology_2d/sample_training.py)

        python3 code/python/morphology_2d/sample_training.py


6. Perform pixel classification with [Ilastik](https://www.ilastik.org/). Load the training sets and process the focal sequences in batch. Directory = main/experiments/ilastik

7. Organize probability maps by species and pool ID. [Link to Python script](./code/python/morphology_2d/organize_tif_by_species_well.py)

        python3 code/python/morphology_2d/organize_tif_by_species_well.py

8. **Python**: Segment cells and take 2D morphology measurements. [Link to Python script](./code/python/morphology_2d/segment_chlamy.py)

        python3 code/python/morphology_2d/segment_chlamy.py

   **Cellprofiler**: Alternatively, segment the cells and take measurements in Cellprofiler with the pipeline chlamy_segment.cppipe. [Link to Cellprofiler pipeline](./code/Cellprofiler/chlamy_segment.cppipe)

9.  Identify the maximal area measurement per focal sequence. [Link to Python script](./code/python/morphology_2d/max_area_focus_seq.py)

        python3 code/python/morphology_2d/max_area_focus_seq.py

10.  Parse per pool mean measurements. [Link to Python script](./code/python/morphology_2d/parse_2d_morphology.py)

        python3 code/python/morphology_2d/parse_2d_morphology.py

## Script for generating vector graphics of idealized cell

This script will generate a vector graphic of an idealized cell. The user may define the 2D morphology measurements in the script. The output is a vector graphic. For related results [follow this link](https://research.arcadiascience.com/pub/result-chlamydomonas-phenotypes#nj8khdxj90e). [Link to Python script](./code/python/idealized_cell/chlamy_modeler.py)

    python3 code/python/idealized_cell/chlamy_modeler.py

## Protocol for visual and qualitative assessments of cell morphology

This protocol is a step by step computational guide to create panels of a video to display difference in the 2D morphology of interfertile algal species. The protocol follows upon the previous protocols in this document. The input is video data of algal cells collected by brightfield or differential interference contrast microscopy, as well as object masks. The output includes videos of masked cells and cumulative average projections of cells.

# Feedback, contributions, and reuse

We try to be as open as possible with our work and make all of our code both available and usable.
We love receiving feedback at any level, through comments on our pubs or Twitter and issues or pull requests here on GitHub.
In turn, we routinely provide public feedback on other people’s work by [commenting on preprints](https://sciety.org/lists/f8459240-f79c-4bb2-bb55-b43eae25e4f6), filing issues on repositories when we encounter bugs, and contributing to open-source projects through pull requests and code review.

Anyone is welcome to contribute to our code.
When we publish new versions of pubs, we include a link to the "Contributions" page for the relevant GitHub repo in the Acknowledgements/Contributors section.
If someone’s contribution has a substantial impact on our scientific direction, the biological result of a project, or the functionality of our code, the pub’s point person may add that person as a formal contributor to the pub with "Critical Feedback" specified as their role.

Our policy is that external contributors cannot be byline-level authors on pubs, simply because we need to ensure that our byline authors are accountable for the quality and integrity of our work, and we must be able to enforce quick turnaround times for internal pub review.
We apply this same policy to feedback on the text and other non-code content in pubs.

If you make a substantial contribution, you are welcome to publish it or use it in your own work (in accordance with the license — our pubs are CC BY 4.0 and our code is openly licensed).
We encourage anyone to build upon our efforts.
