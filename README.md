# Cell morphology analysis

This repository contains code for image processing and analysis to compare phenotypes of interfertile *Chlamydomonas* species. These analyses are included in the publication [Phenotypic differences between interfertile Chlamydomonas species](research.arcadiascience.com/pub/result-chlamydomonas-phenotypes).

![Chlamydomonas smithii has a larger than C. reinhardtii by 20 square microns](https://github.com/Arcadia-Science/chlamy-comparison/files/12021426/Area_microns_superplot1.pdf)
