# Cell morphology analysis

This repository contains code for image processing and analysis to compare phenotypes of interfertile *Chlamydomonas* species. These analyses are included in the publication [Phenotypic differences between interfertile Chlamydomonas species](https://research.arcadiascience.com/pub/result-chlamydomonas-phenotypes).
